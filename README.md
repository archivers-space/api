Serves the Data Together JSON API.

This component in isolation doesn't do much, but when connected to the project as a whole it provides a variety of endpoints over https, which can be used to extract information from the Data Together database.

## Installation and Local Deployment

- install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - if you are new to docker, you may want to test your install with the [default test case](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- in the project directory, run ``docker-compose build && docker-compose up`
- the API should now be running at `http://localhost:3200/`, and the following endpoints should work:
  - http://localhost:3200/urls for a list of URL's in the database
  - http://localhost:3200/urls/{id} for an indivudual URL
  - http://localhost:3200/primers for a list of primers
  - http://localhost:3200/users for a list of users
  - http://localhost:3200/users/{id} for an individual user
  - http://localhost:3200/primers for a list of primers
  - http://localhost:3200/primers/{id} for an individual primer
  - http://localhost:3200/sources for a list of data sources
  - http://localhost:3200/sources/{id} for an individual source
  - http://localhost:3200/repositories for a list of repositories
  - http://localhost:3200/repository/{id} for an in ndividual repository
  - http://localhost:3200/coverage for a coverage tree associated with root URLs
  - http://localhost:3200/collections for a list of collections
  - http://localhost:3200/collections/{id}  for an individual collectoin

### Generating Documentation

THe API documentation is OpenAPI/Swagger compliant and is generated by the `spectacle` node module. You will likely want to explore these docs, so you should generate them!

1. Install [spectacle](https://github.com/sourcey/spectacle) with `npm -g install specatacle-docs`
2. To dynamically generate API docs as you work, run `spectacle -d open_api.yaml` and edit `open_api.yaml` to see changes
3. Generate Static docs with `spectacle open_api.yaml`
4. Commit. Rinse. Repeat.

## Development

Right now modifying & updating code is a huge pain, but this is at least a start.
